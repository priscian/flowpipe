#if the limit is different from 0, a specified amount of events get imported from the beginning of the file. This limits the total size of the dataset, which generally shall not exceed 1M cells

#Numerical transformation is essential to ensure that the expression values on each channel are approximately normally distributed. Choice of NONE, ASINH, DOUBLE_ASINH
transformation=%TRANSFORMATION%

#A factor by which each value gets divided before transformation. 5 is default, but could be set to 3 or lower in order to improve cluster separation on low-intensity channels.
scaling_factor=%SCALING_FACTOR%

#A specified noise threshold will be subtracted from every raw value and then all the negative values will be set to zero. This filters out low-lever noise and GREATLY improves clustering in many dimensions

#Setting this limit above 0 excludes events that have low intensity on all channels (unstained cells)

#Rescaling of clustering channels may help equalizing the extent to which high- and low-expressed markers influence clustering. Choice of NONE, SD, QUANTILE
