# flowpipe
Flow & mass cytometry analysis pipeline

## Preliminaries
The *flowpipe* R package is fairly easy to set up. In an R session:
```
install.packages("remotes") # If necessary.
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = "true") # https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#environment-variables
remotes::install_github("priscian/flowpipe")
library(flowpipe)

## Once the package has been installed as described above, all you need to use it is:
library(flowpipe)
```
